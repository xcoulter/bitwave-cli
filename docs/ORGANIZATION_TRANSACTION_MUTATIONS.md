# Organization Transaction Mutations

Status: implemented locally for testing; not pushed to GitHub or Bitwave upstream

## Safety contract

These commands mutate product transactions in the selected Bitwave
organization. They do not edit the CLI's local ledger.

- Every write requires `--yes`.
- `--dry-run` prints the exact method, path, and body without sending it.
- `--json` emits a versioned success/error envelope for LLM callers.
- Transaction IDs are deduplicated before bulk requests.
- HTTP 429 and 5xx errors are marked retryable in JSON.
- Bulk partial failures exit non-zero and retain every per-transaction result.
- Ignore/unignore waits for an asynchronous server workflow unless `--no-wait`
  is explicit.

Always preview a generated mutation before executing it.

## Needs Review analysis and resolution

Start with the organization-wide transaction health summary used by the
transaction UI and Close Dashboard:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction review summary --org ORG_ID --json
```

The response includes total, categorized, uncategorized, to-be-reconciled,
complete, Needs Review, ignored, awaiting-pricing, failed-pricing,
ready-to-sync, syncing, synced, failed-sync, and marked-synced counts.
`--from`/`--to`, `--wallet`, and `--subsidiary` narrow the summary without
downloading transactions.

For follow-up counts across the full product filter surface, use:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction count --org ORG_ID \
  --wallet "Treasury" --state failed-to-price --json
```

`transaction count` supports wallet, subsidiary, asset, ticker, type, metadata
method ID, workflow stage/state, categorization, reconciliation, ignored
status, transaction ID, from/to/either-side address, operation, amount, FMV,
date, combined/split, Needs Review, and errored filters. It returns a count and
the exact filter request, allowing the caller's LLM to choose its own analysis.

Needs Review is separate from the transaction's ignored state. Inspect the
pending queue without loading the organization's full transaction history:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction review analyze --org ORG_ID --limit 25 --json
```

Pass one or more transaction IDs to analyze only those records. The compact
response compares current and pending lines, wallets, and exchange rates,
preserves full transaction IDs and addresses, and includes the existing
categorization. It reports factual equivalence fields but does not select an
accept or ignore action for the caller.

Preview and resolve reviewed IDs:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction review ignore TXN_ID \
  --org ORG_ID --dry-run --json
bitwave --quiet transaction review ignore TXN_ID \
  --org ORG_ID --yes --json

bitwave --quiet transaction review accept TXN_ID \
  --org ORG_ID --yes --json
```

`review ignore` dismisses the pending changes and preserves the current
transaction and categorization. It does **not** ignore the transaction.
`review accept` applies the pending transaction changes and may remove an
existing categorization, requiring the transaction to be categorized again.

Endpoints:

```text
GET /orgs/{orgId}/transactions/{transactionId}
POST /orgs/{orgId}/transactions/summary_v2
POST /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/count
PUT /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/resolve?action=ignore-pending-changes
PUT /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/resolve?action=accept-pending-changes
```

## LLM workflow: find, narrow, preview, confirm

Users do not need to know a transaction hash. `transaction search` accepts the
same useful dimensions as the transaction UI and returns only 25 matches by
default. Each match is a compact summary with at most five lines; pass `--full`
only when complete objects are needed. For example, find inflows from one
address in one wallet and asset:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction search \
  --org ORG_ID \
  --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31 \
  --wallet "Treasury" \
  --asset ASSET_ID \
  --from-address 0x000000234243234 \
  --operation Receive \
  --limit 25 --json
```

Available filters include `--from-address`, `--to-address`, `--address`
(either side), `--wallet`, `--asset`, `--type`, `--operation`, `--state`,
`--categorization`, `--reconciliation`, `--ignored`, `--transaction`, and up
to five `--search` tokens. Supply the returned `nextToken` through
`--next-token` to inspect another page.

An LLM should show the user a compact summary of matches, then pass only the
reviewed IDs to ignore or categorization commands. It should query
`categorization-options` with the user's words (for example `--query revenue`)
instead of displaying every category and contact.

## Ignore and unignore

Preview:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction ignore TXN_ID_1 TXN_ID_2 \
  --org ORG_ID --dry-run --json
```

Execute:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction ignore TXN_ID_1 TXN_ID_2 \
  --org ORG_ID --yes --json

bitwave --quiet transaction unignore TXN_ID_1 TXN_ID_2 \
  --org ORG_ID --yes --json
```

Endpoint:

```text
POST /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/bulk-state
```

Request transitions are `ignore` and `un-ignore`. `--bulk-action-id` supplies
an optional server idempotency key. If the server starts a Temporal workflow,
the CLI polls:

```text
GET /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/bulk-state/{workflowId}
```

## Categorization discovery

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction categorization-options --org ORG_ID --json
```

The default response returns accounting connections and category/contact
counts, but intentionally omits the potentially large choice arrays. Narrow
the choices before putting them into an LLM context:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction categorization-options \
  --org ORG_ID --query "staking" --json

bitwave --quiet transaction categorization-options \
  --org ORG_ID --accounting-connection CONNECTION_ID \
  --query "fee" --limit 50 --json
```

Filtered choices include category, contact, and accounting-connection IDs.
Categories and contacts carry their accounting connection IDs so an LLM can
avoid mixing records from different connections. Disabled choices are excluded
unless `--include-disabled` is explicit, and each choice array is capped by
`--limit` (default 100, maximum 500).

The response also describes the common single-categorization fields and the
numeric `categorizationMethod` values used by Bitwave. Type-specific line and
asset fields should be derived from `bitwave transaction get` and the selected
Bitwave categorization contract.

## Single categorization

Single categorization is a tagged union whose fields depend on the transaction
and selected type. To preserve Bitwave's complete contract, the CLI accepts a
JSON file rather than a lossy set of universal flags.

First load the complete transaction so the LLM can reason about its lines,
wallets, assets, existing state, and categorization:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction get TXN_ID --org ORG_ID --json
```

This is read-only and calls `GET /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/{transactionId}`.

Preview:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction categorize TXN_ID \
  --input categorization.json --org ORG_ID --dry-run --json
```

Execute:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction categorize TXN_ID \
  --input categorization.json --org ORG_ID --yes --json
```

British spelling is accepted as the `categorise` alias.

Endpoint:

```text
PATCH /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions/{transactionId}
```

The CLI verifies that the input is a JSON object, has a supported `type`, and
has an `accountingConnectionId` where required. The server remains authoritative
for transaction-specific line, amount, wallet, exchange-rate, category, and
contact validation.

## Invoice and bill categorization

Do not guess or hand-author Bitwave's `invoice-v2` JSON for the common case.
The typed invoice commands follow the same contact-first workflow as the web
application: select a contact, load only that contact's eligible invoices or
bills, then match an exact invoice number.

Discover an invoice after resolving a contact:

```bash
bitwave --quiet invoice list \
  --org ORG_ID \
  --contact CONTACT_ID \
  --direction inflow \
  --invoice-number KU7OAN8N-0001 \
  --json
```

Preview the complete categorization using a human-readable contact name:

```bash
bitwave --quiet invoice categorize TXN_ID \
  --org ORG_ID \
  --contact-query "Customer name" \
  --invoice-number KU7OAN8N-0001 \
  --dry-run --json
```

Explorer-style raw Solana signatures are accepted and normalized to Bitwave's
`SOL.<signature>` identifier automatically. Other raw hashes require
`--network`; the CLI will not guess between networks that share hash formats.

Apply the verified match by replacing `--dry-run` with `--yes`. Use
`--contact CONTACT_ID` when the stable contact ID is already known. The command
automatically reads the transaction's wallet, asset IDs, system exchange rates,
accounting value, and transaction price version and then creates the complete
`invoice-v2` request.

`--contact-query` tries Bitwave's indexed name lookup first. If an imported
contact has not appeared in that index, the CLI falls back to the paginated
contact list for correctness and reports `contactSearchMode` in JSON. On very
large organizations, passing the contact ID avoids that slower fallback.

The command validates that:

- the contact resolves uniquely and belongs to the invoice connection;
- inflows use open receiving invoices and outflows use open paying bills;
- the invoice is enabled, awaiting payment, and has sufficient amount due;
- the transaction has one unambiguous non-fee payment line and complete pricing;
- the allocation uses the transaction's authoritative wallet, asset IDs, and
  current price version.

It refuses ambiguous contacts, accidental overwrites, partial or multi-line
allocations, and unsupported foreign-currency differences instead of guessing.
Use the raw `transaction categorize --input` contract only for those advanced
cases. `--force` is required to replace any existing categorization.

## Bulk categorization

The typed form supports Bitwave's bulk `multivalue`, `trade`, and `transfer`
contracts.

Trade example:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction bulk-categorize \
  --type trade \
  --transaction TXN_ID_1 --transaction TXN_ID_2 \
  --accounting-connection CONNECTION_ID \
  --fee-contact CONTACT_ID \
  --fee-category CATEGORY_ID \
  --dry-run --json
```

After reviewing the preview, replace `--dry-run` with `--yes`.

Multivalue additionally requires:

```text
--send-contact
--send-category
--receive-contact
--receive-category
```

Use `--overwrite` only when existing categorization should be replaced.

For advanced or mixed bulk requests, pass the complete API body:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction bulk-categorize \
  --input bulk-categorization.json \
  --org ORG_ID --dry-run --json
```

Endpoint:

```text
PUT /v3/orgs/{orgId}/transactions
```

British spelling is accepted as the `bulk-categorise` alias.

## Create transactions

Creation writes are guarded by the same `--dry-run` then `--yes` workflow.
Amounts are decimal strings, timestamps must be RFC3339, and simple/trade
requests require a caller-controlled `--system-id` so the LLM does not silently
invent or reuse a source identity.

Simple inflow preview:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction create simple \
  --org ORG_ID --wallet "Treasury" \
  --system-id llm-import-20260810-001 \
  --at 2026-08-10T12:00:00Z \
  --direction inflow --amount 1.25 --asset ETH \
  --from-address 0x000000234243234 \
  --dry-run --json
```

Use `--direction outflow` for a withdrawal. Optional fee, address, memo,
description, and blockchain ID flags are available. Categorization at creation
time requires all three of `--category`, `--contact`, and
`--accounting-connection` so records from different accounting connections
cannot be mixed accidentally.

Trade preview:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction create trade \
  --org ORG_ID --wallet "Exchange" \
  --system-id llm-trade-20260810-001 \
  --at 2026-08-10T12:00:00Z \
  --acquire-amount 1 --acquire-asset ETH \
  --dispose-amount 3500 --dispose-asset USDC \
  --fee-amount 5 --fee-asset USDC \
  --dry-run --json
```

This produces acquire/dispose rows, and an optional fee row, tied together by
one trade ID. It calls:

```text
POST /txns/orgs/{orgId}/transactions?immediate=true
```

Internal-transfer preview:

```bash
bitwave --quiet transaction create internal-transfer \
  --org ORG_ID \
  --from-wallet "Treasury" --to-wallet "Operations" \
  --at 2026-08-10T12:00:00Z \
  --amount 0.5 --asset ETH --memo "Treasury funding" \
  --dry-run --json
```

Internal transfers use Bitwave's atomic `CreateInternalTransfer` GraphQL
mutation at `POST /graphql`. The CLI resolves exact wallet names to IDs and
rejects a transfer whose source and destination resolve to the same wallet.

After the user reviews a preview, execute the identical command with
`--yes --json` in place of `--dry-run --json`.

# Bitwave web application parity

Status: living implementation inventory

This document maps customer-facing Bitwave web application capabilities to the
organization-mode CLI. The source of truth is the active UI routes and the
backend requests made by their components, not the text of navigation labels.

## Parity contract

A capability is CLI-complete when it provides:

- the same supported backend operation as the UI;
- explicit organization and resource identifiers;
- machine-readable input and output;
- non-interactive execution;
- dry-run and explicit confirmation for material mutations;
- status/readback commands for asynchronous work;
- complete pagination or an explicit bounded result;
- backend errors without hiding route, status, or response details.

Interactive provider authorization, hardware signing, file selection, and
visual dashboards may still require a browser or device. The CLI should expose
the underlying data, initiation request, status, and downloadable artifacts
where the backend supports them.

The complete Administration command catalog is documented in
[Organization administration](ORGANIZATION_ADMIN.md) and is discoverable with
`bitwave org admin capabilities --json`.

## Delivery order

1. Complete foundational CRUD and exports for categories, contacts, wallets,
   subsidiaries, users, and accounting resources.
2. Complete transaction actions, matching, reconciliation, and advanced data-import workflows.
3. Complete pricing and inventory management/scenario operations.
4. Expose every named report and export-history operation.
5. Add remaining system-job observability.
6. Add AR/AP, data-platform, enterprise administration, and integration flows.

Each slice should be derived from current UI request contracts and shipped with
contract tests. A missing backend operation is recorded as blocked rather than
implemented as a misleading client-side approximation.

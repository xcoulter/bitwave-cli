# Bitwave web application parity

Status: living implementation inventory

This document maps customer-facing Bitwave web application capabilities to the
organization-mode CLI. The source of truth is the active UI routes and the
backend requests made by their components, not the text of navigation labels.

## Parity contract

A capability is CLI-complete when it provides:

- the same supported backend operation as the UI;
- explicit organization and resource identifiers;
- machine-readable input and output;
- non-interactive execution;
- dry-run and explicit confirmation for material mutations;
- status/readback commands for asynchronous work;
- complete pagination or an explicit bounded result;
- backend errors without hiding route, status, or response details.

Interactive provider authorization, hardware signing, file selection, and
visual dashboards may still require a browser or device. The CLI should expose
the underlying data, initiation request, status, and downloadable artifacts
where the backend supports them.

## Delivery order

1. Complete foundational CRUD and exports for categories, contacts, wallets,
   subsidiaries, users, and accounting resources.
2. Complete transaction actions, matching, reconciliation, and import workflows.
3. Complete pricing and inventory management/scenario operations.
4. Expose every named report and export-history operation.
5. Add remaining system-job observability.
6. Add AR/AP, data-platform, enterprise administration, and integration flows.

Each slice should be derived from current UI request contracts and shipped with
contract tests. A missing backend operation is recorded as blocked rather than
implemented as a misleading client-side approximation.
